Comment:
 The clause 3 (the advertising clause) and the clause 4 (the endorsement
 clause) are removed from the original 4-clause license that is deprecated.
 In 2008, the NetBSD Foundation announced that all the code which was
 contributed to the NetBSD Foundation has been modified to use the new
 2-clause NetBSD license.
